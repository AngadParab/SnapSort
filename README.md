SnapSort 

SnapSort is a high-performance Android utility engineered to solve the persistent problem of cluttered mobile storage. By leveraging advanced file system metadata and the latest Android development standards, SnapSort transforms chaotic directories of thousands of files into structured, chronologically organized archives in seconds.

✨ The Problem & The Solution

Most mobile users struggle with "folder bloat"—thousands of unsorted images, videos, and documents in directories like DCIM, WhatsApp Media, or Downloads. Manual organization is tedious and often impossible given the volume of data generated by modern smartphones.

SnapSort automates this entire workflow. It intelligently scans a user-selected directory, extracts chronological metadata, and relocates files into neat, monthly-named folders (e.g., "August 2024"). Unlike traditional file managers that perform slow "copy-and-delete" operations, SnapSort is designed with a "Speed-First" philosophy.

🚀 Technical Excellence

SnapSort is built on three core technical pillars:

Scoped Storage Compliance: Utilizes the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to gain granular, user-approved access to specific storage trees, ensuring full functionality on Android 10 through Android 15+.

Instant "Shallow" Moves: Employs the DocumentsContract.moveDocument API to perform moves at the file-system level. This updates the file's parent pointer rather than rewriting data, making a 2GB move as fast as a 10KB one.

Reactive UI with Jetpack Compose: Features a declarative interface with Material 3 design tokens, including a glassmorphic activity log for real-time, thread-safe updates.

🛠️ Key Features

Automated Chronological Sorting: Intelligent grouping by month and year.

Privacy-Centric: Operates entirely locally on your device with no cloud dependencies.

Recursive Scanning: Deep-dives into subdirectories to extract hidden media clutter.

Safety Safeguards: Built-in logic to prevent redundant moves and directory loops.
